# Welcome to my portfolio!

## Description

Hi there! I'm Anderson and this is my portfolio, here you will find more information about me as well as samples of my work. I've used HTML and CSS for this first step. In the next weeks, I'll be improving my codebase and adding some more languages programming to it. If you have any questions or suggestions on any of my works, feel free to contact me!

Below are a few of the steps I've taken to create the portfolio, as well as screenshots of some of the changes made for reference.

### HTML:

- I have added the portfolio logo between the list items (line 30), so it places right in the middle of my navigation bar.

- I have included a h2 tag, on line 85, written: "Meet you next developer:" with a class of "mediaquery", which was hidden on style.css and only shows for max-width 575px.

### CSS:

- Variables for colors were added to make the code cleaner and more organized.

- I have used flexbox for this project making it better to add media queries. Below are a few exemples.

- Media queries have been added to the bottom of the css file. The breakpoints are: 950px, 768px and 575px.
