# Welcome to my portfolio!

## Description

Hi there! I'm Anderson and this is my personal portfolio, here you will find more information about me as well as samples of my work. I've used HTML and CSS for this first step. In the next weeks I'll be improving my codebase and adding some more languages to it. If you have any question or suggestion on any of my works, feel free to contact me!

This is a company webpage built using HTML and CSS. The main purpose of this project was to refactor the existing code in order to improve its database and make sure the code was running perfectly, making it more efficient and maintainable. Below are the main changes made to improve the code and functionability, as well as screenshot of some of the changes made for reference.

- Company's name has been added to the webpage title in the header;
